DStat communications protocol

Initialization (can be done again even after initialized, if needed):
	Send 'C'
	Reply '#'
	Send 'k'

Command protocol:
	Send '!' - Other characters sent first will be rejected with reply 'C\r\n'
	Send command and arguments (see below)
	Lines replied starting with '#' are human-readable info messages that should be logged
	All commands terminate by replying "no\n\r"
	
Commands - single letter command with arguments in C scanf format :
	ADC setting
		Send 'A'
		Send "%hhx%hhx%hhx" - ADS Buffer/Rate/PGA value
	
	Gain setting
		Send 'G'
		Send "%u" - gain value
	
	Linear Sweep Voltammetry
		Send 'L'
		Send "%u%u%i%i%i%i%u" - t_preconditioning1, t_preconditioning2, v_preconditioning1,
			 					v_preconditioning2, start, stop, slope
		Replies continuously with data after preconditioning time:
			Each point:
				"B\n" followed by uint16 voltage and int32 current, then "\n"
	
	Cyclic Voltammetry
		Send 'C'
		Send "%u%u%i%i%i%i%i%hhu%u" - t_preconditioning1, t_preconditioning2,
 									v_preconditioning1, v_preconditioning2, v1, v2, start,
									number of scans, slope
		Replies continuously with data after preconditioning time:
			Each point:
				"B\n" followed by uint16 voltage and int32 current, then "\n"
			End of each scan:
				"S\n\r"
			End of experiment:
				"D\n\r"
				
	Square Wave Voltammetry
		Send 'S'
		Send "%u%u%i%i%i%i%u%u%u%u" - t_preconditioning1, t_preconditioning2,
 									v_preconditioning1, v_preconditioning2, start, stop,
									step size, pulse_height, frequency, scans
		Replies continuously with data after preconditioning time:
			Each point:
				"B\n" followed by uint16 voltage, int32 forward_current,
				int32 reverse_current, then "\n"
			End of each scan:
				"S\n\r"
			End of experiment:
				"D\n\r"

	Differential Pulse Voltammetry
		Send 'S'
		Send "%u%u%i%i%i%i%u%u%u%u" - t_preconditioning1, t_preconditioning2,
 									v_preconditioning1, v_preconditioning2, start, stop,
									step size, pulse_height, period, width
		Replies continuously with data after preconditioning time:
			Each point:
				"B\n" followed by uint16 voltage, int32 forward_current,
				int32 reverse_current, then "\n"
			End of each scan:
				"S\n\r"
			End of experiment:
				"D\n\r"
